This is a very important tag. A tag marks special commits. 

A tag is a label that makes a commit easier to find.

For example: Add a tag to a commit that corresponds to a files that are

part of a release.

This way, if there is anything that needs to be changed, say, a year later,

you can use the tagged commit to easily find the file that needs to change.

You use the tag command, commit the tag, push to repository.
